# Sales Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **basic data analysis on sales data** using **Python, Pandas, and Seaborn/Matplotlib**.
It loads a CSV file, explores the data, groups and aggregates sales, and visualizes results with charts.

---

## 📂 Files
- `big_sales.csv` → Sample dataset (1,000 rows of sales records)
- `sales_analysis.ipynb` → Jupyter/Colab notebook with code
- `README.md` → Project documentation (this file)

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
  ```

---

## 🚀 How to Run
### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload `sales_analysis.ipynb`
3. Upload the CSV file (`big_sales.csv`)
4. Run cells one by one

### Option 2: Local Jupyter Notebook
1. Install Jupyter:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `sales_analysis.ipynb`
3. Make sure `big_sales.csv` is in the same folder as the notebook
4. Run the notebook

## 📊 Analysis Performed
1. Load data using Pandas
2. View summary (head, info, describe)
3. Aggregate sales:
   - By Product
   - By Region
   - By Month (if Date exists)
4. Visualize results:
   - Bar charts (Sales by Product, Sales by Region)
   - Line chart (Monthly sales trend)

---

## ✅ Example Charts
- **Sales by Product**
- **Sales by Region**
- **Monthly Sales Trend**

---

## ✨ Outcome
By completing this task, you learn:
- How to use Pandas for CSV data analysis
- How to group and aggregate data with `groupby()` and `sum()`
- How to visualize insights with Seaborn and Matplotlib
